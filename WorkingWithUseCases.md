# Introduction #

Use cases describe the detail steps an application or system needs to perform to complete a single task.  It can include multiple scenarios (multiple pathways for a use case to complete; many use cases will encounter exceptional states that need to be accounted for).

Use cases are usually triggered by objects external to the systems being designed--_actors_.
