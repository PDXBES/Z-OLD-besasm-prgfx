# Introduction #

The ASM Programming Framework lays the foundation for the other "besasm" projects by providing common libraries and constructs.  See the [Project Charter](Charter.md) for details on the vision and goals for this project.

This project will answer two questions:
  1. What does the SAMaster database evolve into?
  1. What re-usable tools and functions are related to the data domain we're addressing

# Current Iteration, June 2010 #

Team met for regrouping.  To-do list is

**Team:**

> The priority tasks are
  1. Get Enterprise Architect design procedures operational ASAP
  1. Test NetTiers operations with the current SDE/SQL Server environment and enable rest of the team to start learning how to use NetTiers

> Scrum Call next Monday, 6/14 at 10am.

**Cautley:**
  1. Post NetTiers Multiple Technologies exploration document to code repository
  1. Work with Arnel to complete testing of version controlling procedures with Enterprise Architect, and update cookbook document as needed (currently available in PRGFX repository)
  1. Work on NetTiers usage document so that we will be ready to use it after the demo in July (see Arnel’s Task 3 below)

**Issac:**
  1. Upload SAMaster test tables to SIRTOBY\SANDBOX as GIS user (hopefully before your vacation)

**Arnel:**
  1. Schedule Enterprise Architect demo by June 25 at the latest
  1. Try running NetTiers on tables uploaded by Issac
  1. Schedule NetTiers demo latter half of July (conflicts in late June-early July with Arnold/Arnel)
  1. Schedule Feature Stack brainstorm sessions for designing Data Access Layer to Master and Local “Modeling Document” Data

**Arnold:**
  1. Continue mind crank on NetTiers Multiple Technologies exploration document
  1. Check for company availability of CodeSmith Standard (minimum) or Professional (likely necessary if we are to expand NetTiers code template to cover needs laid out in exploration document)

**Neil/Collins:**
  1. Sit pretty for now until next meetings.
