# Introduction #

There are two kinds of requirements in systems: _Functional_ and _Non-Functional_.  Functional requirements describe user expectations of what a system does.  Non-functional requirements describe what a system is and its qualities.  Functional requirements tend to be very specific.  Non-functional requirements tend to be more general.
